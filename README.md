# Telecom-Churn-Prediction


Telecom firm has collected data of all its customers. The main types of attributes are:
<ul>
  <li> Demographics (age, gender etc.)</li>
  <li> Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.)</li>
  <li> Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.)</li>
</ul>

Based on all this past information, we have to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e. whether they will switch to a different service provider or not. So the variable of interest, i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. It is a binary variable - 1 means that the customer has churned and 0 means the customer has not churned.
